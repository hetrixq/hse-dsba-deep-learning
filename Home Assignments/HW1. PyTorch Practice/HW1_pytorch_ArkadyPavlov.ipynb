The second part (Practice) has graded and ungraded exercises on working with tensors and building your first neural network.\\\n",

If you have found a solution to any of the assignments (or part of it) in an open source, you must provide a link to that source (most likely you will not be the only one who found it, so to exclude suspicion of plagiarism, a link to the source is required).\n",

It turns out that PyTorch allocates the data on the heap and returns the pointer to that data as a shared pointer (see more [here](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/where-does-torch-tensor-create-the-object-stack-or-heap/182753)).
